# Asthriona Nvim
This is my personal config.  
Nothing fancy, and no side bar.  
I actually don't like having this side bar with the files on the side ( whatever the name of that thing is.)  
it makes me feels like I need to use my mouse, and that's not what vim is for.  
  
Anyhow, as I said anything fancy, but just what i need to work, and plugins I know of that is usefull to me.  
  
This is my Lazy branch.  
I used to use Packer, but I moved to Lazy.  
Please check my Packer branch if you wanna use it.
