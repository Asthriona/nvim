# Asthriona Nvim
This is my personal config.  
Nothing fancy, and no side bar.  
I actually don't like having this side bar with the files on the side ( whatever the name of that thing is.)  
it makes me feels like I need to use my mouse, and that's not what vim is for.  
  
Anyhow, as I said anything fancy, but just what i need to work, and plugins I know of that is usefull to me.  
Please check my Packer branch if you wanna use it.  
Also I use [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com) for all the icons and what not. as of right now i'm using [0xProto Nerd Font]().
I might switch to Caskadia NF or something more "conventional" if I get tired of 0xProto
